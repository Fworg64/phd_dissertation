abstract = {Coal bump refers to a sudden catastrophic failure of coal seam and usually can cause serious damages to underground mining facilities and staff. In this circumstance, this paper focuses on the recent achievements in the mechanism and prevention techniques of coal bumps over the past five years in China. Based on theoretical analysis, laboratory experiment, numerical simulation and field test, the characteristics of coal bumps occurrence in China's coal mines were described, and the difference between coal bumps and rockbursts was also discussed. In addition, three categories of coal bumps induced by "material failure" were introduced, i.e. hard roof, floor strata and tectonic structures, in which the mechanism of coal bumps induced by geological structures was analyzed. This involves the bump liability and microstructure effects on bump-prone coal failure, the mechanism of coal bumps in response to fault reactivation, island face mining or hard roof failure. Next, the achievements in the monitoring and controlling methods of coal bumps were reviewed. These methods involve the incorporated prediction system of micro-seismicity and mining-induced pressure, the distributed micro-seismic monitoring system, energy absorption support system, bolts with constant resistance and large elongation, and the "multi-stage" high-performance support. Finally, an optimal mining design is desirable for the purpose of coal bump mitigation. (C) 2017 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

abstract = {In this study, a hyperelastic multiscale modeling technique is used to predict elastic properties of polycarbonate and polyimide polymer systems using a set of widely accepted atomistic force fields. The model incorporates molecular simulations and a nonlinear, continuum mechanics-based, constitutive formulation that incorporates the behavior of the polymer materials as predicted from molecular simulations. The predicted properties of the polymers using multiple force fields are compared to experimentally measured values. Both static and dynamic molecular simulations are performed using molecular mechanics energy minimizations and molecular dynamics simulation techniques, respectively. The results of this study indicate that static molecular simulation is a useful tool to predict the bulk-level nonlinear mechanical behavior of polymers for finite deformations. It is found that the AMBER force field yields the most accurate predicted mechanical and physical properties of the modeled polymer systems compared to the other force fields used in this study.}

ABSTRACT = {Predictions of cutting vibrations are necessary for improving the operational efficiency, product quality, and safety in the machining process, since the vibration is the main factor for resulting in machine faults. “Cutting vibration” may be caused by setting incorrect parameters before machining is commenced and may affect the precision of the machined work piece. This raises the need to have an effective model that can be used to predict cutting vibrations. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model to forecast and classify the cutting vibration of the intelligent machine tool is presented. The factors that may cause cutting vibrations is firstly identified and a dataset for the research purpose is constructed. Then, the applicability of the model is illustrated. Based on the results in the comparative analysis, the artificial neural network approach performed better than the others. Because the vibration can be forecasted and classified, the product quality can be managed. This work may help new workers to avoid operating machine tools incorrectly, and hence can decrease manufacturing costs. It is expected that this study can enhance the performance of machine tools in metalworking sectors.},
