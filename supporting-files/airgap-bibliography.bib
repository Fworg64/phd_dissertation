Experimentally measured forces and smoothing operations are used to establish a numerical model of conical picks subjected to dynamic forces that changes with time during the rock-cutting process. The S-FEMs are extended for dynamics problems of rock picks, so that tetrahedral elements can be used for model generation. The proposed dynamic analysis procedure has been found with several features, including upper bounds for dynamic problems of the Node-based S-FEM, “ultra-accuracy” in both displacement and energy norms in dynamics solutions of the Edge-based S-FEM. These features are beneficial to practical engineering problems whose exact solutions are difficult to obtain, and hence offer an efficient numerical tool for investigating the effects of actual parameters on the performance of picks subjected to various dynamic forces.},

Although coal cutting has been investigated extensively overseas, the results have not led to significant changes in machine design because these machines find little difficulty in cutting the softer overseas coals at a fast rate. In general, the results of the tests show that cutting efficiency improves markedly as the depth of cut per revolution of the drum increases, and that the best spacing of picks on the drum is twice the depth of cut. Pick shape is of secondary importance in terms of cutting efficiency, only small differences having been found between the performances of conical-and chisel-shaped tools.},

   abstract = {Conical picks are the essential cutting tools used especially on roadheaders, continuous miners and shearers and their cutting performance affects directly the efficiency and the cost of rock/mineral excavation. In this study, in order to better understand the effects of dominant rock properties on cutter performance, 22 different rock specimens having compressive strength values varying from 10 to 170 MPa are first subjected to a wide range of mechanical tests. Then, laboratory full-scale linear cutting tests with different depth of cut and cutter spacing values are realized on large blocks of rock specimens using one type of conical pick. Specific energy, cutting and normal force values for relieved and unrelieved cutting modes are recorded using a triaxial force dynamometer with capacity of 50 tonnes and a data acquisition system. Cutter force and specific energy values are correlated with rock properties and theoretical force and specific energy values obtained from widely used theoretical approaches. The results indicate that uniaxial compressive strength among the rock properties investigated is best correlated with the measured cutter performance values, which is in good agreement with previous studies. However, it is also emphasized in this study that Brazilian tensile strength, Schmidt hammer rebound values, static and dynamic elasticity modulus are also dominant rock properties affecting cutter performance. Theoretical specific energy defined by different researchers has a mean ingful relationship with the experimental specific energy, which is an essential parameter for predicting the instantaneous cutting rates of mechanical excavation systems. It is also demonstrated that the experimental cutter forces obtained for 5 mm depth of cut are in good agreement with theoretical force values, if the friction angle between rock and cutting tool is included in the theoretical formulation. It is emphasized that, to some extend, laboratory tests can help to minimize high cost of a trial-error approach in the field. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the journey toward zero harm, rock stress monitoring systems are important for the risk management process. Although communication systems for underground mining have improved significantly over the past two decades, it remains difficult to achieve reliable-all-the-time wireless communication in ultra-deep level underground mines. The aim of this study is to explore and test a smart phone network for communicating sensor data from the underground production environment to the surface. In this paper, the evaluation and performance over distance of a wireless communication system is performed in underground mining environments. The wireless system transmits the data collected from a sensor installed in a narrow reef stope, horizontal tunnel, and vertical shaft area of a mock underground mine. The evaluation was performed using the received signal strength of a mobile receiver over distance. The path loss coefficients of the underground mining environment were then derived for the measurement areas. The results show that a communication speed of 80 Mbps was achieved in a 60 m range, thus, indicating the potential for the support of applications requiring higher data rates.},

Due to the advance of electronic devices and communications technologies, new safety regulations must be accomplished in order to operate underground mines safely and optimally. In 2006, the US government updated safety policies and introduced the PUBLIC LAW109-236. As a result, underground tracking is nowadays mandatory for underground mine operations. This new regulation establishes that current, or immediately pre-Accident location of all underground personnel must be delivered over ground. Despite the recent advances of tracking and positioning systems for indoor environments, underground mines are a unique scenario which poses different and highly demanding constraints for current technologies. Throughout this manuscript an extensive survey on underground mines' positioning technologies is provided. The main characteristics of current localization systems in underground mines are analysed for their implementation from a user's requirements point of view. Furthermore, the main constraints and opportunities of the existing indoor positioning systems to deliver underground tracking are presented. Finally, future research directions are highlighted.},

   abstract = {The mining industry is facing a difficult challenge in the coming decades. High grade ore is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain and production in underground mines is constantly being carried out at deeper levels. This increases the production cost for the companies and a technology shift is needed to secure the production. One solution often discussed is to introduce more autonomous machines and robots in the mine. This would improve personnel safety and also increase the productivity. Autonomous machines are already being used in mines, but often in restricted areas and they are typically not deployed on a large scale. Introducing unmanned machines on a large scale requires a completely new positioning solution compared to those being used today. Current solutions are primarily intended for personnel safety and emergency rescue, but these are not intended nor suited to be used for tracking and controlling unmanned vehicles. The state of the art in positioning technologies has generally had a strong focus on consumer industry; this paper will describe a more challenging research topic, the underground mine. It will describe the state of the art in underground mining positioning applications as well as the foreseen future positioning applications. Taking the special mining requirements into account, the challenges of positioning in underground mines are thereafter identified and discussed. The paper concludes that there are many challenges to solve in several areas, and that the research community has an important role to play.},

Pick life and cutting efficiency were measured under controlled experimental conditions. The parameters investigated included pick type and quality, depth and speed of cutting and the cobalt content of the tungsten carbide pick tips. The tests indicated that the best type of pick for hard rock cutting was the rotating point attack," there was, however, a considerable variation in the quality of point-attack picks supplied by different manufacturers, with the best picks lasting four times longer than the worst. The major factors affecting pick life, other than pick type, are the cutting-head design, and the depth and speed of cutting. The main agent of destruction of picks in hard rock appears to be thermal stress," further developments in tip metallurgy should therefore concentrate on the high temperature properties of tungsten carbide.},

In this study, analyses among wear rate, specific energy, advance rate, and cutter consumption were carried out. The wear mechanisms of two different models of conical picks were examined from different aspects depending on rock and machine parameters. Their relation with the mechanical and abrasivity properties of rocks and petrographic analyses were investigated. In addition, the metallurgic content and Rockwell hardness of conical picks were determined to describe the metal alloys and their effects on the wear of cutting tool. The results showed that the metallurgic content, pick positions, and other environmental conditions influence the wear mechanism. Finally, two different models were proposed to estimate the pick consumption in sandstone and siltstone rocks based on actual data obtained from coalfield.},

At small separations between the plates, it was initially considered in the 19th century by Kirchhoff, who found the leading and the subleading term in the capacitance. Despite a large interest in the problem, almost 150 years later, only the second subleading term has been found analytically. Using the recent advances in the asymptotic analysis of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind with finite support, here we study the one governing the circular capacitor, known as the Love equation. We find analytically many subleading terms in the capacitance at small separations. We also calculate the asymptotic expansion at large separations, thus providing two simple expressions which practically describe the capacitance at all distances. The approach described here could be used to find exact analytical expansions for the capacitance to an arbitrary number of terms in regimes of both small and large separations.},

Thereby, we could improve step coverage and electrical contacting between the two metallization levels, as well as the mechanical stability of the sensor. The smooth polyimide slopes were obtained by combining lithographic resist-reflow techniques with dry etching procedures. We have analytically modeled the sensor's capacitance and its force sensitivity. We have electrically characterized the capacitors using an impedance analyzer and obtained capacitances in the range of 130 pF and a typical force sensitivity of 0.5-1 fF/N, in excellent agreement with our model. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For capacitive sensor realizations are used 3D printing technology using PLA (all sensor's casings elements) and NinjaFlex (membrane) printing materials. 3D printed sensors are applied for displacement measurement. The experimental results of 3D printed capacitive sensors show that they are suitable candidates for displacement application with two range: linear (from 0 to 1200 μm) and nonlinear (from 1200 μm to 1800 μm).},

   abstract = {A new capacitive displacement sensor is designed and fabricated for measurement of a large displacement with very high accuracy. This sensor is a kind of linear encoder with an array of micro electrodes made by micromachining processes. The two pattemed electrodes on the sensor substrates are assembled facing each other after being coated with thin dielectric film. Due to the thin dielectric film, it is highly sensitive to displacement but minimizes expected misalignments such as a tilting error. The sensor fabricated as a sample has a grating of electrodes with a width of lOOpm, which is coated with a Diamond-Like Carbon(DLCj film 0.8 pm thick. The proposed sensor was tested to conclude that its resolution is 9.07 nanometers for the measuring range of 15 millimeters and that the linearity error is expected to be less than 0.02% throughout the measurable range.},

   abstract = {A highly stable motion with orthogonally alternating electric field is established to build the relationship between spatial displacement and time standards. Displacement is measured by counting the time pulses that serve as measurement standards. Thus, a displacement method is called time grating. An orthogonally alternating electric field is generated using two rows of differential capacitive sensing electrodes excited by four sinusoidal voltages. Sine-shaped grating planes rather than hyperfine grating lines are used to pick up the displacement signals. Electrode lead wires are designed below the middle of the electrodes and fabricated using multilayer thin-film technology to suppress the cross-sensitivity effect. A time-grating sensor has been fabricated to evaluate the proposed method. The range of measurement is 200 mm, the width of the electrode is 0.2 mm, the interval between two adjacent electrodes is 20 μm, and the gap for capacitive sensing is 0.3 mm. Experimental results indicate that the measurement accuracy reaches ±200 nm with 1-nm resolution. Nanometer accuracy and resolution are achieved using sensing units with sub-millimeter periods. So, the cost for manufacturing the time-grating sensor can be decreased effectively in comparison to traditional nanometrology displacement sensors, and it may be a suitable low-cost alternative to long-range nanometrology.},

Multilayer perceptron neural (MPL) networks have more various properties than single-layer feedforward neural networks. A deeper neural network is more intelligent and sophisticated, which is one of the main research directions. However, the disappearing gradient is the primary problem that restricts the research. The appropriate activation function is one of the effective methods for solving this problem. A bold idea about activation functions emerged: If the activation function is different in two adjacent training epochs, the probability of the same gradient value will be small. We proposed a novel activation function whose shape can be changed dynamically in training. Our experimental results show that this activation function with 'dynamic' characteristics can effectively avoid the disappearing gradient and can make the multilayer perceptron neural networks deeper.},

   abstract = {Even though a train/test split of the dataset randomly performed is a common practice, could not always be the best approach for estimating performance generalization under some scenarios. The fact is that the usual machine learning methodology can sometimes overestimate the generalization error when a dataset is not representative or when rare and elusive examples are a fundamental aspect of the detection problem. In the present work, we analyze strategies based on the predictors' variability to split in training and testing sets. Such strategies aim at guaranteeing the inclusion of rare or unusual examples with a minimal loss of the population's representativeness and provide a more accurate estimation about the generalization error when the dataset is not representative. Two baseline classifiers based on decision trees were used for testing the four splitting strategies considered. Both classifiers were applied on CTU19 a low-representative dataset for a network security detection problem. Preliminary results showed the importance of applying the three alternative strategies to the Monte Carlo splitting strategy in order to get a more accurate error estimation on different but feasible scenarios.},

Wn, from the standard normal distribution (where n is the number of data points) and let w=(wl, ..., w,) r, ii) compute the residual vector w-A~w, iii) take the 'normalized' inner-product (wT(w-A~w))/(wTw) as an approximation to (1/n)tr(l-A O. We show, both by theoretical bounds and by numerical simulations on some typical problems , that the expected relative precision of these estimates is very good when n is large enough, and that they can be used in practice for the minimization with respect to z of the well known Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) function. This permits the use of the GCV method for choosing z in any particular large-scale application, with only a similar amount of work as the standard residual method. Numerical applications of this procedure to optimal spline smoothing in one or two dimensions show its efficiency.},

@article{Chicco2021,
   abstract = {Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R2) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R2 and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of R-squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.},

   abstract = {R2 can be used correctly to select from among competing least-squares fit models when the data are fitted in common form and with common weighting. However, when models are compared by fitting data that have been mathematically transformed in different ways, R2 is a flawed statistic, even when the data are properly weighted in accord with the transformations. The reason is that in its most commonly used form, R2 can be expressed in terms of the excess variance (s2) and the total variance in y (sy2) - the first of which is either invariant or approximately so with proper weighting, but the second of which can vary substantially in data transformations. When given data are analyzed "as is" with different models and fixed weights, sy2 remains constant and R2 is a valid statistic. However, then s2, and Χ2 in weighted fitting, are arguably better metrics for such comparisons. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
