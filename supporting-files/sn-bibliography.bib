This paper presents the correlation analysis of cutting force, acoustic emission signals, tool life, and surface roughness. We present the details of the dominant features discovery, which have a high correlation with tool wear and surface roughness. The best compound features found by the correlation analysis are verified by multiple regression models and are used to construct fault estimation models. A case study of tool wear and surface roughness estimation is presented. The good agreement between the estimation results of real tool wear and surface roughness data demonstrates the usability of acoustic emission signals in tool condition monitoring. © 2013 IEEE.},

This paper investigates an online tool condition monitoring method using acoustic emission signal in milling operation. The flank wear (VB) is investigated as the system fault. The nature of faulty signals in tool condition monitoring (TCM) is time varying. Therefore time-frequency transformation is an ideal analysis tool for signal interpretation. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT), Wavelet transform, S-transform, the smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution and the Choi-Williams distribution are used for signal decomposition and two-dimensional (2D) principal component analysis (PCA) is implemented for dimensionality reduction. A 2D correlation analysis represents the deviation of the faulty signals from the healthy signal and a curve fitting approach is used to find the tool fault. Experimental tests are used for validation and the efficiency of each time-frequency transformation method in the designed TCM system is evaluated and compared.},

   abstract = {Dental restoration begins with removing carries and affected tissues with air-turbine rotary cutting handpieces, and later restoring the lost tissues with appropriate restorative materials to retain the functionality. Most restoration materials eventually fail as they age and need to be replaced. One of the difficulties in replacing failing restorations is discerning the boundary of restorative materials, which causes inadvertent removal of healthy tooth layers. Developing an objective and sensor-based method is a promising approach to monitor dental restorative operations and to prevent excessive tooth losses. This paper has analyzed cutting sounds of an air-turbine handpiece to discriminate between tooth layers and two commonly used restorative materials, amalgam and composite. Support vector machines were employed for classification, and the averaged short-time Fourier transform coefficients were selected as the features. The classifier performance was evaluated from different aspects such as the number of features, feature scaling methods, classification schemes, and utilized kernels. The total classification accuracies were 89% and 92% for cases included composite and amalgam materials, respectively. The obtained results indicated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

So, AE sensor is employed into identification of tool wear in this paper. Because of the diversity and time varying of AE, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are employed to analyze AE signal. EMD is suitable for analyzing non-stationary signal, and SVM possesses excellent classification capacity for small samples. According to these features, a method of identifying fault of tool wear based on EMD and SVM was presented. The characteristics of the tool under different conditions were extracted by EMD, and the tool wear was identified by SVM classifier. Experiment results show that the method based on EMD and SVM is suitable for identifying tool wear, and the rate of successfully identifying is 95%. ©2009 IEEE.},

In the experiment, the tool wear state was divided into: normal cutting, medium wear and severe wear.

abstract="We address the problems of 1/ assessing the confidence of the standard point estimates, precision, recall and F-score, and 2/ comparing the results, in terms of precision, recall and F-score, obtained using two different methods. To do so, we use a probabilistic setting which allows us to obtain posterior distributions on these performance indicators, rather than point estimates. This framework is applied to the case where different methods are run on different datasets from the same source, as well as the standard situation where competing results are obtained on the same data.",
