\chapter{Load cell design comparison
\label{chap:load_cell_compare}}

Force on the cutting tool is determined by the tool geometry and the material.
The force is also influenced by the dynamics of the machine.
The physical sensor system also has dynamics, and depending on the model, 
these dynamics can be non-stationary.
For rock cutting, two different capacitive load cell designs were tested.

The first design that was tested had non-linear, non-stationary dynamics.

The second design was more linear and the bias could be tracked and compensated.

The air gap design could work for applications with more gentle load profiles.
