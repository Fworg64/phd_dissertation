\chapter{Sensors Technology Literature Review\label{chap:3}}

For this iteration of the smart bit project, many different sensing technolgies were considered.
Rock cutting tools are consumed quickly during underground mining, and need replaced frequently
to maintain cutting efficiency. 
Sensors at the cutting interface must be low power, low cost, and robust 
to be sucessful in the underground mine.
A table of different sensing technologies and requirements is shown in ~\ref{tab:sense_review}
Each sensing technolgy has different pros and cons, and are discussed in the following subsections.
