\chapter{Sensor Linearity
\label{chap:10}}

Dynamic system comparison between strain gauges and sensor

Plots of channel values and force prediction

Able to estimate side and drag forces as well, but normal force has greatest magnitude.

In the appendix we have MATLAB code for the sensor models,
simulation procedure for calculation of capacitance and fringing effects,
and the laser weld procedure used to assemble the sensor.
