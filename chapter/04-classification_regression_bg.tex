\chapter{Method Selection}

Motivated by the selection of thin film polyimide sensors, 
models for their deformation were studied for this work.
The deformation of polyimide is linear for thick films
and small deformations, but for thin films, 
on the mesoscale of hundreds of micrometers,
polyimide films have nonlinear deformation.
These characteristics are manifested as creep, hysteresis, 
and temperature dependence.

Thin film deformation can be modeled using viscous elements, as shown in \ref{fig:sense_model}.
This is only an approximation, and depending on how nonlinear the dielectric deformation response is,
this model might not accurately capture the dynamics of the system.
The system overall is nonlinear, and with a material this viscous,
cycling the film rapidly will result in changes to the vibrational modes.

    \caption{A model of the sensor as a system of springs and dampers. 
             The PI can be modeled with a general visco-elastic model with
             repeating Maxwell elements. Here, it is summarized as $K_p$. 
             The springs representing the steel case top and bottom, $K_{top}$ and
             $K_{bottom}$, are much stiffer than the midsection. 
             Similarly, $K_{walls}$, of the steel case, is much stiffer than $K_p$.
             Thus the total device stiffness is readily approximated by 
             the stiffness of the device walls.}

The stackup for the sensor membrane for the first iteration of the capacitive load cell
is shown in \ref{fig:stackupsense}. This model had a very thin inner layer, which resulted
in nonlinear dynamics. The next iteration of the sensor uses a thicker membrane,
which results in a more linear sensor. 
The non-linearity of the first design was not an issue for tool wear or material classification,
but did impede using the measurements for force measurements. 
The next iteration of the design improved the sensor linearity.

tall while the inner layer is 25 $\mu$m. The adhesive layers are 15 $\mu$m and the copper
layers are 12 $\mu$m. The total membrane height is about 100 $\mu$m. Due to the very thin
thickness of the dielectric film, the deformation characteristics will be dominated
by the interaction of the complex molecular chains and are expected to be nonlinear.

Other items which govern the vibrational forces during cutting include
the material type and the tool wear. 
Different rock types have different fracture mechanics, 
and these differences can be measured and classified.
Different tool wear levels require different amounts of cutting force,
and will result in changing fracture mechanics dependent of the tool's geometry.

All of these changes in vibrational modes and forces can be tracked in the
frequency domain as changes to the emitted spectra. For this research,
it is known that energy is moving from certain vibrational
modes to other vibrational modes across the categories of material type
and tool wear. This shift in energy over the spectra can be measured
by using the magnitude of the Fourier transform coefficients for a 
short duration sample.

As the Fourier spectra magnitude coefficients change, these changes 
can be used to classify the conditions that caused them.
We use data-driven classification techniques to identify these differences and 
predict the cutting conditions.
The methods are the K-Nearest Neighbors, the support-vector machine, and multilayer perceptron classifier.
