\chapter{Classification and regression techniques}

Nonlinear deformation of polyimide films

Motivation for Fourier transform

Dynamic sensor -> chaning modees


How classification is done in other domains

physical model for sensors? - described in chaper 10

Linear, Neural Network, SVM... Use an empirical model instead!
