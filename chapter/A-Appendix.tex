\appendix{Laser Welding Procedure}\label{app:laser}

To assemble the steel case, a laser welding procdure was used.
To determine optimal laser welding properties, a small study was performed
The following test matrix is explored, keeping shielding gas set as argon at 55 ft$^3$/s.
The test matrix is shown in \ref{tab:lasers}.
12 tests fit on 2 samples, using 6 45 deg arc tests per sample. 
There is about 90 deg of the sample taken up by the tabs.
The OD of the ring is 3.8", giving about 1.5" per test. 
This is allocated as 1" of test and two 0.25" buffers on either end.
The best result was with 400 W and 60 in/min. (1 in./s) lasing.
The exact laser welding procudure is listed below. A fixture was constructed to provide the right angles.
The case was mounted in a fourth axis via a magnetic holder.
