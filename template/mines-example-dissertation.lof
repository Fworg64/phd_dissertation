\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {\relax Figure\nobreakspace {\relax 6}.7}{\ignorespaces Here is a really long caption for the figure that will follow on the next page. So I have to make this caption really long. I can get this system to work but unfortunately the user will have to pay extra attention to the text wrapping because it will not do it one its own !!! This is very important. The figure is actually outside of the figure environment. So Clear the page, then insert the caption and label in the figure environment, and then clear the page again. This way you can add the [p] placement marker which will center the caption vertically on the page. Next add the figure after the second clear page with only include graphics and not in any figure environment. The image is one made by the author of this template document, Claudia Schrama, where a Moku:Lab instrument is used to analyze a circuit using the frequency response analyzer function. \relax }}{18}{figure.caption.22}
